            <h1>Welcome to WireGame!</h1>
            <p>
                WireGame is a simple cell-based "game", where the objective is to build simple digital circuits.
                As you can see, it's&hellip; uh&hellip; not really a game.
                But maybe you'll find it fun.
            </p>
            <h2>Rules</h2>
            <p>There are two types of cells: wires and switches. Wires can be charged when at least one cell in the wire's 8 adjacent neighbors is charged. Switches require two neighbors to be charged.</p>
            <p>The actual behavior of the simulation can be pretty complicated despite its simple rules; the best way to learn how it works is to try building your own creations!</p>
            <h2>Controls</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Drag with your mouse to place cells; scroll to zoom. Hold <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> or drag with the middle mouse button to pan.</li>
                <li>Click on cell types in the menu at the top-left or use the indicated keybinds to change the selected type.</li>
                <li>Click the play/pause button or press <kbd>Space</kbd> to toggle whether the simulation is running. Press <kbd>T</kbd> to single-step the simulation.</li>
                <li>You can control how fast the simulation runs using the slider at the top.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>And most importantly: happy wiring!</p>
            <p>Oh, and also check out our <a href="https://github.com/adrian154/wiregame">GitHub repo</a>! Beware that some of the CSS is tragically bad.</p>
